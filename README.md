# Percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012.

This project is focused on presenting a lot of information through a graphic while seeking simplicity and objectivity.

[The Department of Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp) releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women in the U.S.A. from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

[Randal Olson](http://www.randalolson.com), a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website. You can download the dataset Randal compiled [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv). You can see his approach [here](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/).

In this project we use data visualization to show the gender gap in all the fields.
