# Percentage of Women with Bachelor's Degrees (1970-2012)

## Objective

This project aims to present clear and objective visualizations to support governmental efforts in developing campaigns to promote the advancement of women in universities and the workforce. By understanding the gender gap in bachelor's degree attainment, the project provides valuable insights that can help design effective strategies for encouraging female participation and success in higher education and career fields.

[The Department of Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp) releases a data set annually 
containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women in the U.S.A. from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up 
into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

[Randal Olson](http://www.randalolson.com), a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made 
it available on his personal website. You can download the dataset Randal 
compiled [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv). 
You can see his approach [here](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/).

In this project we use data visualization to show the gender gap in all the fields.

## Technical Details

- Created a dashboard of line charts illustrating the gender gap trend in bachelor's degrees awarded to women and men from 1970 to 2012.
- Used Python packages such as Matplotlib for plotting and Seaborn to improve visual aesthetics and effectiveness.
- Set axis limits and removed distractions to present clean and straightforward visualizations.

## Impact

Highlighted Engineering and Computer Science as the most challenging fields for female inclusion, enabling the government to 
design more targeted and cost-effective interventions.

## Visuals

Multiple linecharts arranged in a matrix of subplots.

## Dependency Versions

The Python environment used in this project can be set up in Anaconda using the python_env.yaml file.
